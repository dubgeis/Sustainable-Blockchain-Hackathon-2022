About Hedera & the HBAR Foundation 
Hedera Hashgraph is a fully open source, proof-of-stake, public network and governing body for building and deploying decentralized applications. It offers developers three primary services: Solidity-based smart contracts, consensus, and token services. Hedera is unique in that it is incredibly fast, energy-efficient (carbon negative), and secure.
The HBAR Foundation Sustainable Impact Fund (SIF) has been established as the first fund of its type in the industry to help do our part in solving the climate crisis and address these challenges on Hedera. 
The SIF supports projects through funding, support, and by raising awareness of projects that measurably change how the world works in a specific and attainable way across Environmental, Nature-based, and UN Sustainable Development Goal focused projects to facilitate systemic change for the planet.
